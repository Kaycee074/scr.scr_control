	\section{Introduction}
	This project is a ROS package containing scripts to control the lights, blinds and HVAC, and read data from sensors in the Smart Conference Room. In order to run any of the scripts, ROS must be installed and \verb|roscore| must be active. Information on ROS can be found at \url{http://wiki.ros.org/}.
	

	
	\section{Setup}
	
	
	Robot Operating System (ROS) must be installed in order to run these scripts.
	
	\subsection{Installing ROS}
	To install ROS Lunar, follow the tutorial on the ROS website (\url{http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation}).\\
	After installing ROS, you need to source its setup.*sh files. To do this, run:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	    $ source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
	    
	\end{verbatim}
	This command needs to be run on every new shell in order to access ROS commands, unless you add it to your .bashrc.\\
	See the tutorial at \url{http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment} for more information. \\  \\
	To use ROS on windows, you can install Ubuntu using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For more information, use the following microsoft tutorial: \url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10}
	
	\subsection{Creating a Workspace}
	Making the ROS package requires a catkin workspace. To create a new workspace, create a new directory and run \verb|catkin_make| in it. For example:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	    $ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	    $ cd ~/catkin_ws/
	    $ catkin_make
	    
	\end{verbatim}
	Now you have a workspace, which also needs to be sourced. To source your workspace:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	    $ source devel/setup.bash
	    
	\end{verbatim}
	As the workspace also needs to be sourced in every new shell, adding a command to source the workspace to your .bashrc is very convenient.\\
	See the tutorial at \url{http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment} for more information.
	
	\subsection{Downloading the Package}
	Now ROS should be all setup. The package is available from \url{https://github.com/onetarp/light_control}. You can download or clone the file into the \verb|src| folder in your catkin workspace.
	
	\subsection{Running Scripts}
	Before you start running any scripts from the package two things need to be done.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run \verb|catkin_make| in the top level of your catkin workspace
		\item Run \verb|roscore|
		
	\end{enumerate} 
 	\verb|roscore| launches the backbone of any ROS-based-system which is required for ROS nodes to communicate. \verb|roscore| can be closed at any time by pressing \keystroke{Ctrl}+ \keystroke{C}.\\
 	Now you can run any command in the light\_control package by opening a new shell and using:
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	    $ rosrun scr_control [script_name] <commands> 
 	\end{verbatim}
 	In general, you will need to run the server for any component of the Smart Conference Room before running any of the clients.
 	
 	\subsection{Running ROS from multiple machines}
 	In order to run the client and server on separate machines, first install ROS on both devices. Follow instructions in sections 2.1 - 2.4 to install ROS on both machines.
 	
 	\subsubsection{Test communication between devices}
 	First, it is important to test whether the machines can communicate with eachother. \\
 	To test communication between multiple devices use:
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	$ ping [ip or hostname of other device]
 	\end{verbatim}
 	To check the ip address of the current device, run \verb|ifconfig| \\ \\
 	If one or more devices are running windows, it may be necessary to edit firewall settings.
 	To do so, open \verb|Windows Defender Firewall| and navigate to \verb|Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules|. Enable rules titled \verb|File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)|
 	
 	\subsubsection{Set environment variables}
 	On the master device (that will be running \verb|roscore|) run \verb|roscore| \\
 	Part of the output should read: ROS\_MASTER\_URI=http://[device]:[port]/ \\ \\
 	On all machines, run the following command using the device and port shown on the master device.
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://[device]:[port]
 	\end{verbatim}
 	Additionally, on each machine, run the following using the device ip or name of that individual machine
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	$ export ROS_IP=[device]
 	\end{verbatim}
 	To avoid setting these variables in each terminal, these commands can be added to your .bashrc (See the bottom of 2.2)
 	
 	\subsubsection{Run the server and client}
 	You should now be able to run the server and client scripts on separate machines. \\
 	If you are still having troubles, see the relevant ROS tutorial: \url{http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines}
 	
 	\section{Server}
 	
 	\subsection{Running the Server}
 	To run any server:
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	rosrun scr_control SCR_[]server_name]_server.py
 	\end{verbatim}
 	The names of each client can be found at the beginning of their respective section. \\ 
 	If the server prints:
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311]: master may not be running yet. 
 	Will keep trying.
 	\end{verbatim}
 	Then \verb|roscore| is not running. Open another shell and run \verb|roscore| and the server should run.
 	
 	\subsection{Closing the Server}
 	The light server can be closed at any time by pressing \keystroke{Ctrl}+\keystroke{C} in the shell in which the server is running.
 	
 	\section{Client}
 	
 	\subsection{Client}
 	The client sends messages to the server to change the color of a light at a specified position or return the CCT or intensity value of a light at a specified position if it has been changed before.\\
 	
 	\subsection{Running the Client}
 	For the client to run any commands, the light server must be running first.\\
 	To run the client:
 	
 	\begin{verbatim}
 	$ rosrun scr_control SCR_[client_name]_client.py [command] [arguments]
 	\end{verbatim}
 	The names of each client can be found at the beginning of their respective section.
 	

	\section{Lights}
	The lights in the Smart Conference Room have many parameters controlling their color. Each light has five color options, red, blue, green, amber and white. Each color can be set from 0\% to 100\% intensity to produce different combinations of colors. Each light can also be set to specific CCT's and overall intensities. \\
	
	To run the light server run:
	\begin{verbatim}
	rosrun scr_control SCR_PentaLight_server.py
	\end{verbatim}
	
	To run the light client run:
	\begin{verbatim}
	rosrun scr_control SCR_PentaLight_client.py [command] [arguments]
	\end{verbatim}	

	
	\subsection{Configuration}
	Three text files are required to correctly configure the light server.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \verb|SCR_PentaLight_conf.txt|\\
		This file contains a list of the IP addresses of the lights in the system, as well as a position array of the lights. The format of the file is as follows:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		    192.168.0.111
		    192.168.0.112
		         .
		         .
		         .
		    192.168.0.n
		    -
		    10011001
		    00100100
		    10011001
		\end{verbatim}
		
		The first part of the configuration file is a list of IP addresses for every light in the system. The second part is an array representing the position of lights in the room. The number of 1's in the array must equal the number of IP addresses. A 1 represents a light and a 0 represents empty space. The IP addresses are assigned to positions in order. In the above example, light 1 would have IP address 192.168.0.111 and coordinates (0,0). Light 2 would have IP address 192.168.0.111 and coordinates (0,2). Light n would have IP address 192.168.0.120 and coordinates (4,2). The two parts are separated by a dash (-). 
		
		\item \verb|SCR_PentaLight_CCT.txt|\\
		This file contains the color values needed to produce different correlated color temperatures (CCT's). The CCT's available range from 1800 K to 10000 K in increments of 100. The format of the file is as follows:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		    #cct    red amber green blue white
		    1800	0.840241787	0.909269192	1	0.011311029	0.194062057
		    1900	0.763359902	0.859734808	1	0.00379065	0.251035096
			                           .
			                           .
			                           .
		    10000	0.087561979	0	0.005743162	1	0.481888995
		\end{verbatim}
		
		The first column is a CCT value, followed by the values for red, amber, green, blue, and 
		white in each following column. Each column is seperated by a single tab. The values for each color are percentages of intensity for that individual color with 1 being maximum intensity.
		
		\item \verb|SCR_PentaLight_int.txt|\\
		This file contains coefficients for each color of light to achieve a linear curve for light levels ranging from 0\% to 100\% intensity. The format of the file is as follows:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
			-0.0826	1.0943
			-0.1120	1.1145
			-0.1451	1.1478
			-0.1718	1.1782
			-0.0476	1.0513
		\end{verbatim}
		
		The first value on each line corresponds to the squared term when determining the intensity of a particular color. The second value on each line corresponds to the first power term. The coefficients on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth line correspond to blue, green, amber, red and white respectively. For example, given a value for the intensity of blue $i_b$ between 0\% and 100\%, the final intensity for blue $I_b$ would be calculated as follows:
		\[I_b = -.0826i_b^2+1.0943i_b\]
	\end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}

	\section{In Python}


\subsection{Imports}
Because python only searches the current path for imports, you must add the corresponding script folder to your python path before importing any clients. \\ \\
Additionally, all functions have the optional argument debug which defaults to False, and determines whether debug information should be printed.

\subsection{Commands}
Running any of the commands in a python script is similar to running from the command line. In the case of the lights, to run light commands from a python script use:
\begin{verbatim}
SCR_PentaLight_client.[command]([arguments])
\end{verbatim}


For example:
\begin{verbatim}
import sys
sys.path.append(“/path/to/package/scr_control/scripts/lights”)
import SCR_PentaLight_client as light_control

light_control.ragbw_all(100, 0, 0, 0, 0, debug = True) 
# Prints out: "Changing all lights to red:100% amber:0% green:0% blue:0% white:0%"
\end{verbatim}
